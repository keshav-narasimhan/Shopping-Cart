# Shopping-Cart

This is a simple Java project I made to emulate the interactive interface of a shopping cart. The project creates a GUI that allows the user to determine how many of each product they would like to buy, while the GUI will calculate and display the cost automatically. In the main method, the user can also modify the names and costs of different products. For certain products, the user can also implement bulk prices, which can be utilized if the user purchases a certain quantity threshold.
